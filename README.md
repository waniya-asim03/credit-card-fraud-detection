## 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained to classify transactions as *Fraud* or *Legitimate*, and a **Streamlit web app** is built for interactive prediction.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from Kaggle:

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** The dataset contains 284,807 anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders, with only 492 labeled as fraudulent (~0.17%), making it highly imbalanced. Features are mostly PCA-transformed (V1–V28), plus `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class` (target label). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
