💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained to classify transactions as *Fraud* or *Legitimate*, and a **Streamlit web app** is built for interactive prediction.
